## How to Install 🛠️📥

Installation is straightforward for PC users. Follow these steps carefully:

### For PC (Windows) 🖥️
1. Download the latest liquid mod menu download from the official link above.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice using tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Launch GTA V in story mode first to test compatibility.
4. Use a reliable injector (such as Extreme Injector or Xenos) to inject the DLL file.
5. Open the menu in-game with the default hotkey (usually F4 or Insert).
6. Configure options as needed and enjoy!

**Note on Mobile (Android/iOS)**: The liquid mode menu is primarily designed for PC due to GTA V's platform limitations. Mobile versions of GTA (like San Andreas) have separate mods, and GTA Online on consoles/mobile does not support mod menus like this. Attempting on restricted platforms may not work and could violate terms. Stick to PC for best results. 📱❌

Always disable antivirus temporarily during injection, as it may flag DLLs falsely.
